This directory several scripts for sampling a microphone hat, running the MARS
project on the sampled data, parsing the MARS output into X-Y-Z coordinates,
and finally publishing the MARS output as a 3D vector to a ROS topic.

The scripts are:
"sample_mics.sh", which samples a microphone array using the Matrix Creator
microphone demo. The script is configured by two environment variables (at the
top of the file), "REC_DIR", which points to the directory of the microphone
demo binary, and "PRE_DIR", which points to an output directory.

"output_tracking.sh", which runs the MARS project on data generated by "sample_mics.sh".
The script is configured by three environment variables (at the
top of the file), "TRACK_DIR", which points to the directory of the MARS project
binary, "CONFIG", which points to the MARS configuration file,
and "PRE_DIR", which points to an output directory. It is assumed the "PRE_DIR"
is identical for both "sample_mics.sh" and "output_tracking.sh".

"parse_tracking.py", which parses MARS output into X-Y-Z coordinates and publishes
the output to a ROS topic. This script assumes the MARS output is passed by
filename as its first argument, i.e. "parse_tracking.py /tmp/fetchbot/tracking.out".
